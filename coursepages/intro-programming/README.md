# Introduction to Programming

If you've never written a for-loop, or don't know what a string is in programming, start here. These courses are self-paced, allowing you to adjust the number of hours you spend per week to meet your needs.

We are currently looking for volunteers to try out both of the following two courses and analyze them in different ways so as which one is better suited to be included in our  curriculum.

We suggest you to flip a coin to decide which one to take first, so that you avoid an ordering bias. Once you have completed both the course, please provide your analyisis on [this RFC](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/issues/1164).

If you don't have time or do not want to volunteer, you are required to do **only ONE** of the follwing courses.

## CS50P: Introduction to Programming with Python

This course has been made by the CS50 team at Harvard University.
> An introduction to programming using a language called Python. Learn how to read and write code as well as how to test and "debug" it. Designed for students with or without prior programming experience who'd like to learn Python specifically. Learn about functions, arguments, and return values (oh my!); variables and types; conditionals and Boolean expressions; and loops. Learn how to handle exceptions, find and fix bugs, and write unit tests; use third-party libraries; validate and extract data with regular expressions; model real-world entities with classes, objects, methods, and properties; and read and write files. Hands-on opportunities for lots of practice. Exercises inspired by real-world programming problems. No software required except for a web browser, or you can write code on your own PC or Mac.

**Note**: This course is *different* from CS50 or CS50x. CS50 is not a part of OSSU curriculum. That being said, if you have completed CS50, you can skip this course and move on to the next one.
