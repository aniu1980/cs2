# Getting help
## Check the FAQ!
Please check our [Frequently Asked Questions](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/blob/master/FAQ.md) to see if your question has been addressed.
## Ask in the chat room
OSSU uses discord for conversations. [discord](https://discord.gg/5pUhfpX) is an online chat service, similar to gitter or IRC where you can chat with other students and get help.

### Specific problems
If you need help successfully completing the content of a course or are having general technical difficulties, first reach out to the resources provided by the course (e.g. the course forum on Coursera, edX, etc). If you need additional help after that, make a post on gitter. **In your post, mention what steps you have already taken to try and solve the problem**.
### General problems
If you have general problems with the program not specific to any course, such as preferring textbook-style learning over MOOCs, gitter is a good place to reach out to people who may have great suggestions.
